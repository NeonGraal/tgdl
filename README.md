# [Tiny Graph Description Language][tgdl]



Started with Haskeleton! If you haven't heard of it before, 
I suggest reading the introductory blog post.
You can find it here: <http://taylor.fausak.me/2014/03/04/haskeleton-a-haskell-project-skeleton/>.

Working on this with the Stack commands you know and love.

``` sh
# Build the project.
stack build

# Run the test suite.
stack test

# Run the benchmarks.
stack bench

# Generate documentation.
stack haddock
```

Thanks again, and happy hacking!
